# Examples of games with pygame

- Python: https://www.python.org/
- pygame: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

## Purpose of this repo

To consolidate Python and pygame resources, examples, snippets, games. Help and collaborate with the community in doing so.

## Content

A few templates and examples of games from me and others, code from tutorials and from the web.

I have updated and reviewed/refactored considerable chunks to make some of them work, and so they are in line as much as possible with 
Python best practices and the latest versions (you may still find inconsistent naming conventions and some 
Python code remanescense from before Python 3).

Some code would have required too much refactoring to solve it in the appropriate way, so some hacky quick solutions were taken to just make them work.

Whenever possible (since I found content scattered around from various places) I kept the original `readmes` and `docstrings` from the authors.

A massive thank you to all the Python community and the pygame community that made all this code possible.

Consolidating this has been a pleasure and I hope it is useful for a lot of people out there trying to 
get into game development and/or Python.

I have tested everything with:

- Python 3.6+
- pygame 2.0.1+

However it is highly likely older versions will work as well. Some of the code here, even though updated, was created with much older versions of both Python and pygame.

Look into `requirements.txt` for the dependencies. These should cover all the dependencies for all the games and source code available in this repo.

In general, only `pygame` is the only dependency really required, however there is use of `numpy`, `Pillow` and `PyOpenGL`.

Using the `math` module from the standard library can replace `numpy` for many operations, but `numpy` is obviously more performant.
