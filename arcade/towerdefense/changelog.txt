*Removed PlayerUpgradeScreen. Removed PlayerUpgrades.
*Icons are now initialized by Towers. Icons fit better into the tray.
*Sections of the screen are now much more easily differentiated.
*Removed XPBar. Removed player xp.
*Added an Infobox for enemies. Put your cursor over an enemy to find info about it.
*Added support for scaling square size. Changed default square size to 30x30.
*Far and away simplified tower stats. Now all contained in the Tower class, instead of in player.modDict.
*Added sidebar for tower info/buttons.
*Added support for enemies having a "level", both a default for the map, as well as adjustments for individual enemies.
*Massive changes to player class. Removed most of modDict, as no need. Added better support for saving and loading.
*Adjusted XP modifiers for simplicity and readability.
*Only the strongest, active slow-timer affects an individual enemy now.
*Simplified damage function to enemies.
*Removed multi-placing towers, the cost associated with such, and all references to modDict from Tower class.
*Removed ability list, button list, and the need for a reload function from Tower class.
*Added Runes to the game. Towers are simply vessels that use Runes to attack/heal/etc.
*Added concept and support for "Support" Runes. Runes which improved or change the effects of other runes.
*Added Rune slots for towers. Only runes in the primary ("Alpha") slot are Active Runes. All others support that Rune.
*Added support for certain Runes only fitting in certain slots. Each slot will eventually have certain properties.
*Added support for a "spare runes" list in player object. Included saving and loading of list.

--------------
Version 0.8.6:
--------------
[Released: December 16th, 2012]
*Each Basic map now gives +1 Tower and +5 Starting Money.
*Added customization options for each Tower's image.
*Added a main menu, allowing to pick maps from a better interface, as well as
    edit tower images to your liking. Will also accommodate an options menu, in
    the future.
*Added menu functionality for rearranging tower abilities, as well as
    implemented automatic saving of changes to tower abilities and images.
*Converted the format for mapproperties.txt files, allowing for ease of entry,
    as well as multiple different types of enemies in the same wave.
*Upgrades now rarely modify tower costs. Pumping up towers while increasing base
    costs was counter-intuitive. Now, each copy of a tower you place increases
    the cost of further towers of that type. This will incentivize spreading out
    tower abilities.
*Enemies now have an element of randomness in their walk.
*Enemies now rotate their images, based on their temporary destination.
*Enemy waves now come automatically, after about 10 seconds, if not sent before
    that.
*Towers now regenerate health a small amount over time.
*Maps converted to new format: Basic0, Basic1, Basic2. This means Ability0,
    Basic3, HitPoints0, and HitPoints1 are UNPLAYABLE!.

**Note On Difficulty: Any BasicX map assumes you have beaten all other X-1 maps.
    Any other X map assumes that you have beaten BasicX already.**

--------------
Version 0.8.5:
--------------
[Released: November 18th, 2012]
*Towers are now upgraded based on maps completed. Upon beating a map, if it
    gives a bonus to a specific tower, it will pull up a selection window. Most
    upgrades that apply to a specific tower will increase its cost, so a balance
    is needed between making badass towers and keeping tower costs low.
*Experience gained during a battle improves all stats of all your towers, and
    reduces their costs. However, the experience only stays until the end of the
    current map.
*The Chain Bonus now goes to battle experience, thus the higher your chain
    bonus, the quicker your towers will gain their temporary bonuses.
*Added three new maps.

--------------
Version 0.8.4:
--------------
[Released: NEVER]
*TODO: Add in Ranger Ability: Slow.
*Changed block rate to accommodate any percent chance, not just multiples of 5.
*Changed some locations of Player Upgrades.
*Added support for giving a percent bonus to towers' HP.
*Implemented the Ranger tower's ability to slow enemies, as well as other
    upgrades for it.

--------------
Version 0.8.3:
--------------
[Released: June 15th, 2012]
*Took the Achievement system back out.
*Added in an XP bar at the top of the screen. XP per level starts at 10 and
    increases each level by 50% of the previous level.
*Implemented support for saving and loading XP states.
*Added in a Player Upgrade Screen, accessed by right-clicking the XP Bar.
    Right-click to get out of the Player Upgrade Screen.
*The Chain Bonus now applies to XP gains instead of tower stats.
*Tower Upgrade Screen removed, as it is replaced by the Player Upgrade Screen.
*Player Upgrade requirements implemented. Most player upgrades require at least
    one other upgrade, shown as a line connecting the two upgrades.
*Number of available Player Upgrades is shown on top of the XP bar in red.
*Player Upgrades you currently have are Green. Player Upgrades you qualify for
    are Blue, or not hued at all if there is an icon image for it. Player
    Upgrades you do not qualify for are Red.
*Moved Tower Access over to the Player Upgrade Screen, it is no longer
    determined by maps completed.
*Rolled icons over for Player Upgrade Screen.
*Fixed a bug where losing all a player's lives did not stop them from continuing
    play.
*Player.modDict now populates dynamically, making expansion much easier.
*Killing all enemies in a wave gives 50 plus five times the wave number plus
    five times the map number XP.
*Added a new tower: the Ranger; specializing in longer range, medium damage, and
    slow attack speed. It eventually has the ability to slow enemy units.

--------------
Version 0.8.2:
--------------
[Released: Never]
*Fixed the tower selling function to accurately return the money spent.
*Achievement system outline put into place. Not yet operational though. These
    achievements will provide static, passive bonuses to a variety of things.
*Towers now display their attack ranges when you move the cursor over them,
    instead of when they are selected.
*A tower upgrade screen is now in place. Clicking on a tower pauses the game
    while you pick upgrades. Selling is also accomplished through this menu.
*Achievements implemented for Spender and Healer.
*Now, any upgrade you have earned will show up on a tower's upgrade screen.
    Those the tower does not qualify for yet will be shown in red. Those it
    already has are shown in green. Those it will never qualify for (meant for
    different tower type) are not shown.
*Added new tower abilities for the Mage tower, as well as the second level of
    Archer for Fighter towers.
*Lowered starting money to 25, to compensate for being able to increase it
    through Player Upgrades.

--------------
Version 0.8.1:
--------------
[Released: April 14th, 2012]
*Optimized the distance formula for finding enemies within range of a tower.
*Added a chaining system: the chaining bonus increases by 1% each time an enemy
    is killed. It decreases automatically over time. Each tower gets a different
    bonus from a chain: fighter towers gain a damage bonus, archer towers gain
    a range bonus, and mage towers gain a speed bonus.
*Fixed an issue with centering enemies on the path.
*Added hp, maxhp, and ac stats for towers.
*Added attack bonus and damage stats for enemies.
*Enemies now attack towers in range, with a similar function to towers.
*Towers that are at 0HP or below cannot attack until brought above 0HP.
*Towers that get to -10 HP or below are destroyed.
*Towers heal at a rate of 1HP per enemy wave.
*Added the "Cleric" tower. It heals every tower and damages every enemy within
    range each time it fires. Its damage is unaffected by enemy armor.
*Lowered player health to 10.
*Fixed the formula for the location of the text for upgrades when displayed in
    the radial menu around a tower.
*Removed some stats from towers that were unused.
*Corrected a tower's totalspent variable to take into account tower abilities.
    Now, selling a tower gives you exactly half of everything you spent on it.
*Changed tower abilities to modify a tower's base variables by a percentage.
    This way works better when stacking abilities. Certain tower stats will be
    modified by static amounts, and never by percentages.
*Added a new line of abilities: specific upgrades that mimic a "class
    progression" or "level up" in an RPG.
*All archer mod variables have been removed from the player class.
*Added support for changing what stat is improved by chaining.
*Class upgrades, including archetypes, are unlocked by completing levels.
*Class upgrades increase the tower's level. Towers now heal their level in HP
    for each wave sent.
*Added the Negative Cleric archetype, concentrating on area damage by giving up
    the ability to heal other towers.
*Switched the Mage tower for the Cleric tower as the second default tower.
*Changed the current map names to show intended progression better. "Basic0"
    corresponds to "Simple", and the following "Basic" maps correspond to the
    "Level" maps. It is recommended you clear you player.txt file.
*Rewards are now as follows:
    -Basic0: Gives the option to sell a tower. Allows upgrading a Fighter tower.
    -Basic1: Allows upgrading Cleric towers. Opens Archer archetype.
    -Basic2: Allows ExtraDamage1 ability. Opens Mage tower for use.
    -Basic3: Allows ExtendRange1 ability. Allows the second Fighter tower level.

--------------
Version 0.8.0:
--------------
[Released: March 10, 2012]
*Added new Archer tower art.
*Properly implemented the "CostMod" variables.
*Changed the player levelup system: Player abilities are now determined by the
    maps they have completed, and the rewards those maps give (see Rewards.py).
*Save/Load functions, as well as the Player class have been updated for this.
*Simplified the "player.txt" file as a result.
*Each map also has a related function in Rewards.py. When loading a player.txt
    file, each map that player has completed will run its related function from
    Rewards.py, granting bonuses or new abilities to the player.
*Changed the completedMaps variable to a set, so multiple wins on the same map
    will not give multiple bonuses.
*Modified the maps to be slightly more interesting.
*Does not save on each new wave, now only saves at the completion of a map.
*Melded the tower's sell function into "TowerAbilities", so that it may be
    granted from completing the "Simple" map.
*As Scores are no longer used, removed all references to them from the code.
*Removed PlayerUpgradeMenu.py and references.
*Removed textbox.py. There should be no references.
*Removed abilities.py and references.
*Removed functions "addCR" and "addHP" from player class.
*Added text at the top of the screen telling players to press 'N' to send the
    next wave.
*Adjusted the base stats for the two base towers. Both are now the same price,
    with the Fighter tower doing higher damage at a slower rate and the Archer
    tower doing low damage at a medium rate with a large range.
*Added an armored enemy type: "Armor".
*Added new tower: "Mage". Has high hit rate, average damage, yet very low range.
*Changed Icon creation so it is a function from player.modDict['towerAccess'],
    thus allowing giving new towers for winning maps.
*Corrected some code to allow for correct displaying of tower ranges.
*Added new Fighter tower art.
*Added an alpha'd white layer underneath tower images, as they are getting hard
    to see.
*TODO: Range is not working correctly!!!
*Range correctly working now.
*Got rid of Enemy Types, allowing finer-grained control in mapproperties.txt.
*Changed out the enemy's path tiles. While the previous looked a bit better,
    this simplifies path-crossing.
*Level3 implemented.
*Changed some tower ability names and filenames.
*Changed tower abilities so most of them can only be bought once-per-tower. In
    other words, it's now worthwhile for different maps to grant similar
    abilities. Note that granting the SAME ability will not do any good.
*Removed options.txt and references in code. The only option that was even
    active was the targetline option. It is now hardcoded as active.
*Removed quite a few unused files from the backgroundimgs folder.

--------------
Version 0.7.7:
--------------
[Released on: January 28, 2011]
*Added player saving: 's' key. No loading yet, though.
*Enabled changing of speed: UP arrow increases, DOWN arrow decreases.
*Implemented a "High Score" mechanism.
*Added display of "High Score".
*Added score variable for EnemyTypes.
*Player class changed around considerably.
*Loading is implemented and working.
*Added a Player Upgrade Screen, accessible by pressing 'u'.
*Changed wave sending to a KEYDOWN event, as per Donpachi's suggestion.
*Mapmenu changed to disregard files which begin with a period. Due to using svn,
    a file is created that begins with a period and was showing up in the map
    list as a playable map... which it wasn't.
*Curvy map removed, as it was an invalid map from an olllld version.

--------------
Version 0.7.6:
--------------
[To be released on: January 15, 2011]
[Actually released: January 13, 2011]
*EventFunctions.leftCheckSelect added to check for clicking on icons or towers.
*Mouse click events changed so you can select a different tower even when there
    is already a tower selected.
*Mouse click events changed so you can left click an empty area to deselect a
    tower.
*Towers can be selected directly even with an icon selected.
*EventFunctions now return True if they had an effect, and False if no actions
    were taken.
*Towers no longer print their damage amounts (part of the debugging code was
    left in, in the last release).
*EventFunctions.placeTower created to handle placement of towers.
*EventFunctions.leftSelectedIcon created to check for valid conditions to call
    placeTower.
*EventFunctions changed to typically return in the form: selected,XXXb where
    XXXb is a boolean indicating change, with XXX being the function initials.
*EventFunctions.leftAlreadySelected created to manage left clicking while having
    a selected that isn't changing.
*EventFunctions.mouseButtonUp created to handle entire mouse click event
    structure.
*Changed "if" statements in event checklist to "elif" for a (very) slight bump
    in event speed.
*EventFunctions.nextWave created to handle the event of asking for next wave.
*MainFunctions.dispIcons created to handle display of icons.
*Main event structure slightly reworked to, again, bump the speed very slightly.
*MainFunctions.workEvents created to completely handle all events.
*Event structure modified (yet again) to re-enable quitting...
*Began moving base enemy stats into types: EnemyTypes created.
*Enemy speed changed to base=1.
*Type column in mapproperties replaces XP column.
*Enemy types: Weak (1 cr, half hp) and Healthy (2 cr, 3/4 speed, but high hp).
*Since enemy cost is now held in EnemyTypes, the Cost column of mapproperties
    is changed to Time. This is the delay between each enemy in a wave.
*EnemyType Speedy added: half again cost and speed.
*Player starts with only 30 cr, towers costs are reduced, tower ability costs
    reduced.
*Simple map's mapproperties changed around, possibly balanced (?!?!), and end
    wave added.
*localdefs.genEnemyImageArray changed to load different images for each type.
*Tower abilities now check to see if player has the needed credits to upgrade.
*Now, when a Tower is selected and showing its abilities as icons, you can move
    the cursor over an icon and it will display the name and cost/profit for the
    option.
*Ability icons' info now is restricted to the screen.
*Fixed new issue with using upgrades.

--------------
Version 0.7.5:
--------------
[Actually released on: January 9, 2011]
*Towers and Icons selected now display range as a translucent filled circle
    instead of simply a lined circle.
*Towers selected now display their upgrade and sell options as a radial menu
    set around them instead of listing in boxes to the right.
*Artwork done for icons for Bonus Damage, Extend Range, and Sell options.
*Tower.genButtons changed as a result. Simplified.
*Extra towers removed to work up from simply Fighter and Archer towers.
*XP completely removed.
*XP tables/lists removed.
*Upgrade slots removed.
*Tower abilities cost changed.
*Currently both towers qualify for both abilities.
*Player class given Mod variables for all towers, and for specific types of
    towers, allowing for extensive customization to take place.
*Tower stat calculation drastically changed to accomodate Abilities and Player
    Mod variables.
*Targeting changed and simplified, though is inconsistent with range displayed.
*Fighter and Archer base stats changed. Archers are weaker, more expensive, but
    much quicker to fire.
*Turns are advanced by the "n" key now.
*Panel removed, as is now unneeded.
*PanelClass file removed, as is now unused.

--------------
Version 0.7.0:
--------------
[To be released: Never]
[Actually released on: Never]
*Created the MainFunctions file. It holds most of the individual functions
    called in the main game function. This makes things a whole lot more neat
    and clean.
*Created the InterfaceClass file. It will hold the nexttextpos rect and the
    selected pointer so that they may be passed to MainFunctions and modified.
*Created the EventFunctions file. It will hold (hopefully) all the individual
    functions related to the different events in the game.
*Removed Menus. They aren't needed yet, and don't seem like they ever will be.
*Removed Buildings. They seemed to add a bit of confusion, especially to the
    code, while not offering much in-game.
*Removed the print commands from the PoisonTimer class.
*Changed how Slow works. Now instead of having a SpeedupTimer that activates
    after a certain amount of time and moves the enemy's speed back up, each
    enemy instance keeps however many SlowTimers they need to, and each's
    duration counts down separately, and the strongest still-active effect is
    chosen each time the enemy moves. SlowTimers use frames for their timing.
    This change allows for an enemy to be, say, slowed for 100 frames at 80% of
    its speed, yet be temporarily slowed for 30 frames at 50% of its speed, and
    it will speed back up on its own once the 30 runs out.
*Simple map has been changed to only two enemy paths. Making it more, well,
    "Simple" lol.
*Started rewriting class functions to be based on frametime instead of amount of
    frames.
*Sender class rewritten to work off frametime.
*Sender objects are removed from senderlist when they are done. (Why didn't I do
    this a long time ago?)
*Towers work off frametime.
*Enemies work off frametime.
*Base costs and ranges are class variables now, instead of being held in
    localdefs.
*Speed system modified.
*Upgrades changed to a single level up, not separate things. Each upgrade can
    increase various stats.
*Modified to force towers into individual squares.
*Support for tower ranges based on squares.
*Tower experience and costs modified.
*Enemies and towers balanced a little more.
*PanelClass created to keep track of the majority of the future interface.
*Moved the Next Wave button into PanelClass....
*And its actually working now!
*Exchanged nexttextpos in towerdefence.py for PanelClass.Panel.nexttextpos.
*Sell button changed and now blitting to the panel. Will move to PanelClass.
*Moved Upgrade button to blit on the panel, changed as well.
*Removed printing of tower range height.
*Added and implemented TowerAbilities.

--------------
Version 0.5.7:
--------------
[To be released by: 5 April, 2010]
[Actually released on: 1 April, 2010]
*Wave 11a-20a of Map Simple and Curvy are still not balanced.
*Updating readme.txt.
*Adding better documentation for the mapmaker.
*Added a bit more comments.
*Introduced feature of towers needing 'power' from a link to the base.
*Added 'Node' tower, which can extend powered area.
*'Power' feature removed, too complex at this point.
*Building class created. This is the backend for any structures that aren't
    towers.
*Changed enemy speed from 3 times the speed value in mapproperties to just the
    value in mapproperties. This allows greater and easier customization of
    enemies' speed.
*Fixed bug where map would end if there were only enemies coming from 'c' and/or
    'd' paths.
*Hopefully fixed a bug where the next map would load in a small window, but this
    is unlikely.
*Fixed the next-map-small-screen bug, but have realized that switching maps is
    going to be a whole lot more complex than I had expected. I'm declaring that
    to be a "Not-yet-implemented Feature" for the time being.
*Minor update to mapmaker: Can't save without a base (avoids a common error).
    Also, began adding step by step instructions to the top of the screen.
*Added Poison tower.
*Enemies will have a green health bar when poisoned.

--------------
Version 0.5.6:
--------------
[Actually released on: 14 March, 2010]
*Fixed a bug in the map switching / game ending code, which would allow someone
    to "win" by just clicking "Next Wave".
*Fixed a common bug where a slow tower would slow down an already slowed enemy,
    then the enemy would "pop" back to its original speed.
*Added a map selecting menu. When starting the game, now, a very simple
    selection menu will come up first. The only playable map at this point is
    Map '1'.
*Added an optional description for map files. Simply put a 'description.txt'
    file in your map's folder to see it come up in map selection.
*Added support for map names other than numbers (i.e. Map '1' is now named
    'Simple').
*MapMaker created!!! Run this separately from the game itself from mapmaker.py.
*Added a Textbox class, taken primarily from DrakeMagi in the thread:
    http://www.python-forum.org/pythonforum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=12895
    Easily the best implementation I've seen.
*Wrote Map Maker Guide in the readme.txt.
*Corrected a bug where enemies would leave the screen and be 'removed', but
    their .move() function would still run, causing a crash.

--------------
Version 0.5.5:
--------------
*Update graphics from:
    http://lostgarden.com/2005/03/game-post-mortem-hard-vacuum.html
    By the way "Danc" thanks for releasing the game art!
*Added the final two paths for the first map. Still not sure if this is the
    direction I want to take the game, but it's making it a little more
    interesting already. Please note, though, that the game is YET AGAIN
    unbalanced, and incredibly hard to beat thus far.
*Balanced out an odd skip in enemy stats. I'll look more at these soon.
*Basic tower is green, slow is blue now...
*Added the Cannon tower back!
*Updated the way towers generate their "buttons" to be more versatile... which
    leaves the door open to a surprise tower I hope to get up and running soon!!
*Made enemy movement much more fluid! No more "snapping" to corners.
*All enemy actions contained in Enemy.taketurn() now.
*Separate moneystolen from enemy.cost.
*Enemy.die() added to simplify all the different Tower.target()'s there now are.
*Corrected some bugs when approaching the last wave.
*Worked on rebalancing waves of enemies. 1-10 are done, 11-20 ARE NOT BALANCED!

--------------
Version 0.5.4:
--------------
*Changed HP back to losing one every time an enemy leaves the screen. You now
    start with 20 HP, and gain 0.25 HP per turn.
*Has a "Next Wave" button. Does exactly what you think it does.
*Implemented the 'slow' ability for towers. It's pretty awesome :D
*Changed the 'range' price. Its now 20, plus 20 for each range upgrade.
*Added 'super slow' ability for towers. 'slow' brings enemies to 75% of their
    speed for 1.25 seconds; while 'super slow' brings enemies to 50% of their
    speed for 2 seconds.
*New support for multiple enemy paths in a map.
*Pausing has been removed. There are no timers anymore, just hit "Next Wave"
    whenever you want a new wave to come and take as much time between as you'd
    like!
*Can have waves where the enemies come from different paths simultaneously.
*Tower is now a base class for all towers, each of which will be a different
    class.
*Testing of selected is now based on __class__ object instead of __name__ for
    Icon and Menu, and is based on containing Tower in __bases__ for Tower. This
    is more accurate, better code, and will lead to better performance and
    adaptability in the future.
*Icon class now holds a type and the type's towerstats.
*towerstats has become Basictowerstats, and Slowtowerstats has been created.
*SlowTower class created.
*Trimmed down the project folder. I hadn't realized how much extra, useless crap
    there was just lingering in it.
*Towers now generate their upgrade/sell buttons. This will make it easier to add
    new upgrades for other towers.
*Slow towers can now upgrade the 'amount of slow' applied to enemies, and how
    long it lasts.
*Enemies' move modified for accuracy (can now handle float movement), and speed
    coefficients made equal (they move the same distance whether vertical or
    horizontal).

--------------
Version 0.5.3:
--------------
*Ability rects/blits code space optimized.
*Sender class created. These are the objects that control the 'waves' in the
    game. Now, if the game is not paused, you can press Space and the next wave
    will begin while any other will still be going.

--------------
Version 0.5.2:
--------------
*Removed Enemy health options from Options.txt because they weren't used.
*Tried to balance out towers more.
*Increased money gained from enemy kills by 1 credit per enemy.
*Health is now gained: (waveNumberCompleted * player.hpt), where hpt is usually
    one, until abilities are implemented.
*Began commenting some more.
*Towers cannot be placed in the path!
*Tower upgrade buttons are now in the lower right hand corner.
*Player abilities are implemented! Regen gives you extra health each
    wave you defeat; while Interest gives you a boost to your interest rate.
*There is now a 'base' in the middle. Enemies will head toward the base, steal
    credits from you, then head back toward to entrance. If an enemy steals
    credits and you kill it before it gets to the entrance, you will recover
    the stolen credits. This gives you two chances to kill the enemy before it
    hurts you.

--------------
Version 0.5.1:
--------------
*Removed all in-source comments other than those at the top and bottom of the
    main code file. Any comments from now on can be considered up-to-date.
*Menu support updated for callback functions. Menu constructor now takes a list
    of tuples in this format: (String,Callback).
*Menu moving changed to work with right- or middle-button.
*Enemycounter increased to 7, to make the game easier.
*In code: Selected and Towerselected have been merged into Selected.
*In code: Selected and Menuselected have been merged into Selected.
*Towers' Attack, Range, and Speed are upgraded separately now.
*Towers will stay selected if upgrading, but de-select if selling or clicking
    elsewhere.
*Towers' Attack, Range, and Speed have independent costs, based on stats gained.
*HOPEFULLY.... more balanced....
*Enemies that make it through restart at the beginning, so you're still able to
    get money from them.

--------------
Version 0.5.0:
--------------
*Added Enemy image rotations as per Gabriel Baptistussi.
*Enemy images/rotations in pre-generated,pre-loaded array for quickness.
*Added print notifications during loading.
*Added preliminary Menu support/framework. Menus are transparent until clicked 
    on. You can drag them around the screen as well.
*Added preliminary Ability support/framework. Acquiring abilities not yet
    implemented, however some abilities are working by way of keyinput.
*Downtime and startup have been integrated into the main play loop. As a result,
    during this time play is simply 'paused'. Seems to work much better, and be
    more efficient.
*genBackground MUCH more optimized. Play now starts almost instantly, instead of
    15-ish second wait.
*Only one tower type now. Will implement tower upgrading 'into' other types
    (i.e. all towers start as 'basic', but you will be able to upgrade it to
    'fire' or 'slow').
*All tower upgrades are 50 credits. No max level. This is UN-BALANCED!
*Enemy stats are all read from mapproperties.txt files in the map folder.
*Enemies all have the 'none' trait. Changed this a while ago to counteract the
    massive randomness in enemy traits. Enemy traits are still coded (I believe)
    they just aren't accessed at all.
*Nope, enemy traits have been removed because all former traits could be given
    by editing stats in mapproperties.txt.

Disclaimer: The comments in any source file may or may not be accurate! They
    have not been updated in quite a few versions. I plan on working on them
    quite soon.

-*-*Lots more. I've been tinkering with this off and on for a while and stopped
    logging changes.

--------------
Version 0.3.6:
--------------
*Raised armor value.
*Added "super armor" trait.
*New folders, files sorted into them.

--------------
Version 0.3.5:
--------------
*Slowed enemies down.
*Slow tower now slows to half the start speed.
*All upgrade levels are now 2/3 of the original cost.
*There's now 5 frames between the release of each enemy.
*Increased default enemy health.
*Slow tower weakened.
*New enemy image. (Actually tried this time. Though it borrows heavily from
    other TDs).
*Corrected a bug where the 'sell price' wasn't showing in downtime or startup.
*'Sell price' now still shows when the tower is fully upgraded.
*Now, when enemies reach the end of the path, the health they have left over is
    deducted from the player's health. In light of this, default player health
    is now 150. This value may need balancing.
*Player health is now an option in options.txt.
*Can now exit the game from downtime and startup.
*Player health is recovered 2 health per wave.
*Wave number and enemy type for the next wave is now displayed in downtime.
*Armor implemented.

--------------
Version 0.3.4:
--------------
*Explosions.
*New enemy image. Not the best.... but it's better than a blue square :)
*Options are now in options.txt. True has to be 1 and False is 0.

--------------
Version 0.3.3:
--------------
*Now you can't place a tower touching another tower.
*Has the option of drawing lines to the enemies when a tower hits them. You can
    turn them off by changing targetlines to 0 in localdefs.py.
*There's a pause between waves. You can adjust the length by changing wavedowntime
    in localdefs.py.
*Can change enemy health boundries: In localdefs.py, lowerhealthmultiplier and
    higherhealthmultiplier are the lowest value and highest value, respectively,
    that can be multiplied to the wave number to generate the enemies' health.
    For example: Default is 7 and 8, so for wave 10, the lowest enemy health could
        be 70 and the highest it could be is 80. For wave 25 they would be 175
        and 200, respectively.

--------------
Version 0.3.2:
--------------
*New tower: slow.
*Tower rebalance.
*Better support for multiple maps/beggining support for progressing levels.
*Basic timer class LocalTimer and SpeedUpTimer for slow towers, both in localdefs.
*Can sell towers now! Just right- or middle-click on a selected tower.

--------------
Version 0.3.1:
--------------
*F key now changes to Fullscreen mode.
*W key now changes to Windowed mode. (default)
*Single script now split into multiple files.

--------------
Version 0.3.0:
--------------
*Expensive enemies now give you only 1.25 times the credits.
*Cheap-O enemies now give you .75 times the credits, and have a tenth less life,
    but are faster as well.
*Rebalancing of towers, at least until the higher levels (basic and fire towers
    end up being useless around wave 60 or so).
*Each tower type upgrades differently now.
*Added cannon tower, which has splash damage.
*Icons at the bottom now tell the type and the price when mousing over.
*You now have 30 seconds before the start to place and upgrade towers. You can
    press Space to skip remaining time once you are done.
*Enemy type is now displayed at the bottom. This is the CURRENT type.
*Twice the chance of an enemy group have no trait ('none').
*Cheap-O and High HP enemies now have a normal health bar, i.e. High HP enemies
    had a health bar 1.5 times longer than others and Cheap-O enemies had empty
    space between the red and the end of the black.
*Changed images for basic and cannon towers.

--------------
Version 0.2.6:
--------------
*Towers now have 4 levels.
*Enemies have a chance to have "traits":
    -None: Basic enemy.
    -High HP: Half again it's usual HP
    -High Speed: Speed factor is increased by one
    -Expensive: 1.5 credits per enemy
    -Cheap-o: Only .5 credits per enemy
*Redone graphics for 800x600 res. (Saves a ton of time)
*Bullets have been removed for the time being. The class is still there, but is
    not implemented.
*If a tower has no enemies in range, it will keep its "ready to fire" state until
    there is one. (Had problems with enemies passing through Sniper's range)
*There is now a "movefile". This specifies what points enemies will head to.
*Redone movefile.

--------------
Version 0.2.4:
--------------
*There's a path now!
*Also, now when you're holding a tower, you can click the white bar to de-select it.

--------------
Version 0.2.3:
--------------
*Runs in 800x600 mode now. "Squares" are mostly gone! Unfortunately, right after
    I did that, I figured out how to find the enemy's path and use the desertpath
    image for it... using squares. I've decided NOT to go that route as I am very
    much trying to stay away from squares.
*Movelist is now simplified, instead of pixels it's essentially the row or column.
    I transferred this over from a temporary design using the co-ords in movelist
    as indices for the gamesquares array. Actually works quite well, if I do say
    so myself :)
*Most distances/sizes are now in terms of squsize, so readjusting for various
    resolutions should be a whole lot easier next time.
*A few commenting type-o's.

--------------
Version 0.2.2:
--------------
*Made screen sizing work, though not the greatest solution. I will continue
    to search for the best possible way to do this. Unfortunately, in implementing
    this, I have pushed farther into "gamesquare" territory, i.e. basing it around
    adjacent squares in the game area, instead of individual pixels. Menu coming soon.

--------------
Version 0.2.1:
--------------
*First public release version.
