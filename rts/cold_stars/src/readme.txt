***About GAME***
The ColdStars game is not playable yet, it's more like a demo.
Unfortunately i stopped developing the python version (switching to C++), so no more python version of ColdStars will be coming up in future, sorry.

Note:
a) the game was tested only with python 2.6 (ubuntu 10.10, winXp sp2 as well), not sure how it works with other pythons/distros.
b) make sure the python2.6 and following modules "pygame", "pyopengl", "PIL" are installed in you system.
It is also advised to install psyco module to get better performance for game (but that is not necessary, just a option).
c) to run game you have to run file "main.py" (from terminal or double mouse click)
d) The game by default is require modern video-card (i guess equal or over OGL3.x). If you have old video-card then set in file "constants.py" following flag: OLD_HARDWARE = True.

If you have any question you may feel free to ask me anytime. coldstars8@gmail.com.


Have fun!


*** GAME CONTROL ***
SPACE     - next turn
a         - select/deselect all available weapons (use mouse for targeting)
1,2,3,4,5 - select/deselect each weapon individually

o         - switch on/off orbit draw for asteroids and planets
ESC       - launch ship from uninhabited planet (for inhabited planet use appropriate icon for that)


***About CODE***
Probably some part of code will be useful for someone who are new in game developing. 
I believe my code is trash in some parts, sorry also for this, i am new in programming and also in game developing.
The license can be found on the top of the each file (it's GPL).

***About ART***
All art(except few very simple things which i made with gimp) is not mine. 
I also tried to find as many free for use art(pictures) as possible. The license of each picture/sprite can be different (please find appropriate references to them). If author in any reason is not satisfied that i am using his art, please contact me by email coldstars8@gmail.com and i will remove them then. 

***Thanks to community***
I also wants to say everybody who share some art with others (opengameart.org) and pygame community which helped me a lot to get at least some experience in programming/gamedev.
Thank a lot!
