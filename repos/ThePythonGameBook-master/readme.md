### File and Folder Structure:

This Github repository reflects the file and folder structure of ThePythonGameBook's dokuwiki, its structure and working synapses :

The dokuwiki structure is a bit more complex, because it split' into a 'data' folder for the text of the dokuwiki pages and into a seperate 'media' folder for images etc. Each folder has a top language folder (en, fr, de etc.). As for the moment (2020-05) only the English language part of Dokuwiki is activley maintained the 'en' folder is the only one mirrored into Github.
In this Github repository, everything necessary to create a wiki page (data, media, external html) is merged into the same folder.
