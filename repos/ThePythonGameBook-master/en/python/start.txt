====== Python ======


There exist various resources to learn programming with python. 

See http://www.python.org/doc/ for an overview.

I specially recommend 
  * [[http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python|A Byte of Python]] if you are new in python
  * and [[https://docs.python-guide.org/|hitchhikers guide to python]] after you made your first steps 

[[http://ThePythonGameBook.com|ThePtyhonGameBook]] aims to fill a role in between those guides
