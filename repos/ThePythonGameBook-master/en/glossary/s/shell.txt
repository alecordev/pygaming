A python shell let you run and execute python code directly, line by line. Also called **language shell** or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop|Read Eval Print Loop (REPL)]]. Unlike an [[..:e:editor|code editor]] who let you edit usually several lines and offers options to load and save python files ((''.py''). 



=== terminal ===
If you open a terminal and type python, you can interact with python in direct mode. The difference of just typing ''python'' in a [[..:t:terminal|terminal]] and working in a python shell is that the shell offers usually some advanced functionality, like color-coding, help hints or code completion. 


=== shell and IDE ===
Python's default editor [[..:i:idle|idle]] offers a shell and an editor. Most [[..:i:ide|Integrated Development Editors (IDE)]] offer an code editor and a python shell or at least a terminal. 
  * [[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/|PyCharm]] offers an code editor, a python shell and a terminal
  * Idle (usually installed together with python) offers an code editor and a python shell
